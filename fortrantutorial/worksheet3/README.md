## Worksheet 3: Loops

- Aims
  By the end of this worksheet, you will be able to:
  - Understand more about the use of real and integer variables and how to use a mixture of data types in expressions
  - Understand how to re-use code by looping
  - Know how to control the number of times a section of code is executed by using a do loop

- Mixing variable types: [divide](3.1.f95), [a more complicated example](3.2.f95)
- [do loop, basics](3.3.f95), [practice](3.4.f95)
- [ Nested do loops](3.5.f95)
  - a Fortran-compliant program must use integer variables/expressions, but note that the compiler is quite happy to go along with using reals. These are just warnings. 
- [Using loops to do summation](3.6.f95)
