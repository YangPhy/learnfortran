<h2>11. Many, many more features of Fortran 90 </h2>

<p>There are several very important features of Fortran 90 that
we are unable to cover due to time constraints. Fortran 90 is a
powerful language worthy of far more than the 3 measly hours we
have spent on it in class. </p>

<p>I hope that you will continue to investigate the capabilities
of this language. As a place to start, here a couple of Fortran
90 books I have found useful: </p>

<dl>
    <dt><em>Fortran 90 for Engineers and scientists</em>, by L.
        R. Nyhoff and S. C. Leestma, Prentice Hall, 1997. </dt>
    <dd>This is a fairly complete reference with lots of useful
        examples. </dd>
    <dt><em>Fortran 90/95 explained</em>, M. Metcalf, and J.
        Reid, Oxford, 1996. </dt>
    <dd>This is a fairly inexpensive book that gives a reasonable
        coverage of Fortran 90 and a good introduction to Fortran
        95. </dd>
