<h2>5. Logical expressions </h2>

<ul>
    <li>Symbolic forms of the relational operators are allowed: <pre>
            Old Operator	Symbol
            ------------	------
               .LT.		  <.GT.>
	       .EQ.		  ==
	       .LE.	          <= .GE.>=
	       .NE.		  /=
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>IF-ELSE constructs may be named by attaching a label at
        the beginning of the block: <pre>
	<em>name</em>:	IF (<em>logical argument</em>) THEN
                      <em>statements</em>
		ELSE IF (<em>logical argument</em>) THEN <em>name</em>	
                      <em>statements</em>
                   .
                   .
                   .

		END IF <em>name</em>
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>The CASE construct may be used to execute a set of
        multi-alternative selection criteria: <pre>
   SELECT CASE (<em>selector</em>)
      CASE (<em>list #1</em>)
         <em>statements</em>
      CASE (<em>list #2</em>)
         <em>statements</em>
      .
      .
      .

      CASE DEFAULT
         <em>statements</em>
   END SELECT
</pre>
        <p>The <em>selector</em> may be an integer, character, or
        logical expression. Just like IF_ELSE blocks, CASE
        constructs may also be named. The <em>list #i</em> is a
        list of one or more possible values of the selector
        index. The DEFAULT option in a CASE construct may be
        omitted, but it is recognized as good programming style
        to always include it. </p>
        <p>Consider the following example of the use of the CASE
        construct: </p>
        <pre>
   SELECT CASE (Freq_Fly_Points)
      CASE (:19999)
         WRITE(*,*) 'Keep flying - no free ticket yet!'
      CASE(20000:49999)
         WRITE(*,*) 'Woo-Hoo!!  Free ticket in continental U.S.!'
      CASE(50000:)
         WRITE(*,*) 'Hawaii here I come!!'
      CASE DEFAULT
         WRITE(*,*) 'Sorry - you aren't going anywhere  :( '
   END SELECT
</pre>
        <p>Here we use the CASE construct to evaluate what sort
        of reward we might be entitled to on our favorite airline
        based on the number of accrued frequent flyer points. If
        we have less than 20,000 points, we don't get any
        reward... yet. If we have between 20,000 and 49,000
        points, we can get a free ticket in the continental U.S..
        If we have more than 50,000 points, we are on our way to
        Hawaii!! In this case, the DEFAULT option should never
        execute, but it is there just in case! </p>
    </li>
</ul>
