<h2>2. Main Features of Fortran 90</h2>

<p>Fortran 90 is a new programming language intended for use in
scientific and engineering applications. It is a language that
has developed by the introduction of features that are new to
Fortran, but are based on experience of other languages (like C
and Matlab for instance). Fortran 90 is very different from
earlier versions of Fortran, yet it is completely backwards
compatible with Fortran 77. </p>

<p>The features of Fortran 90 are far too numerous to mention in
entirety here, but some of the key features are outlined below: </p>

<dl>
    <dt>Free format on source code. </dt>
    <dd>In Fortran 90, you can use either the Fortran 77 input
        format or free format. If you use free format, the file
        extension <em>.f90</em> should be used for the file name.
    </dd>
    <dt>Dynamic allocation and pointers. </dt>
    <dd>It is now possible to allocate storage dynamically. This
        enables us to finally get rid of all the &quot;work&quot;
        arrays! </dd>
    <dt>User defined data types. </dt>
    <dd>You can now define your own composite data types, similar
        to <tt>struct</tt> in C or <tt>record</tt> in Pascal. </dd>
    <dt>Modules. </dt>
    <dd>Modules enables you to program in an object oriented
        style, similar to C++. Modules can also be used to hide
        global variables, thereby making the Fortran 77 common
        construct outdated. </dd>
    <dt>Recursive functions. </dt>
    <dd>Now a part of the language. </dd>
    <dt>Built-in array operations. </dt>
    <dd>Statements like A=0 and C=A+B are now valid when A and B
        are arrays. There are also built-in functions for matrix
        operations, e.g., matmul for performing matrix
        multiplication. </dd>
    <dt>Operator overloading. </dt>
    <dd>You can define your own meaning of operators like + and =
        for your own data types (objects). </dd>
