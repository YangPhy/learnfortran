<h2>1. Preface</h2>

<p>The goal of this Fortran 90 tutorial is to give a quick
introduction to the key differences between Fortran 77 and
Fortran 90. It is <em>not</em> a complete reference! Many details
have been omitted. This tutorial is based on the book <em>&quot;FORTRAN
77 for Engineers and Scientists with an Introduction to Fortran
90&quot;</em> by L. Nyhoff and S. Leestma published by Prentice
Hall. </p>

<p>This tutorial was designed by Sarah T. Whitlock to be used in
the course <em>SCCM-001-F: Introduction to Fortran</em> taught at
Stanford University, Winter quarter 1997. It has been modified by
Paul H. Hargrove for use in the Fortran class taught Winter
quarter 1998, under the course number <em>ME-390</em>. Permission
to use this tutorial for educational and other non-commercial
purposes is granted provided all author and copyright information
