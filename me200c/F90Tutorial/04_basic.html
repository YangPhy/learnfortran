<h2>4. Basic program structure </h2>

<h3>Key features </h3>

<ul>
    <li>Free-form source code is allowed. Statements may begin in
        any column. </li>
    <li>Lines may extend to 132 characters. </li>
    <li>More than one statement may be placed on a line. A
        semicolon is used as the delimiter to separate
        statements. </li>
    <li>In-line comments are allowed. These comments begin with
        an exclamation point and extend to the end of the line. </li>
    <li>Continuation statements are indicated by the placement of
        an ampersand (&amp;) as the last non-blank character in
        the line being continued. Up to 39 continuations are
        allowed. </li>
    <li>Variable names may consist of up to 31 characters. Valid
        characters include all letters, digits, and the
        underscore symbol (_). The first character of a variable
        name must be a letter. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Declarations </h3>

<ul>
    <li>The command IMPLICIT NONE is allowed. This feature
        cancels the default naming convention. When invoked,
        program variables MUST be specified explicitly. </li>
    <li>Modified type specification statements may be used to
        initialize variables or parameters, e.g., <pre>
   REAL :: Area = 0.
   INTEGER :: Num_Months = 12
   REAL, PARAMETER :: Pi = 3.1415927
</pre>
        <p>declares Area to be a real variable with initial value
        0., Num_Months to be an integer variable with the initial
        value 12, and Pi a real parameter with the value
        3.1415927. </p>
    </li>
    <li>The separator :: is required in a type specification
        statement whenever it is used to initialize a variable or
        to declare a special attribute (such as PARAMETER). It
        may be omitted in other cases. For example, to declare
        the variable Area_circle to be real, we may say <pre>
   REAL Area_circle
</pre>
        <p>or, equivalently </p>
        <pre>
   REAL :: Area_circle
</pre>
        <p>The latter form is preferred for the purpose of
        uniform programming style. </p>
    </li>
    <li>The precision of a real, integer, complex, or logical
        variable may be specified using a kind type parameter.
        For example, to declare a variable A to be a real number
        with at least 10 decimal places of precision with a range
        of at least -10^34 to 10^34, do the following: <pre>
   REAL(KIND = SELECTED_REAL_KIND(10,34)) :: A
</pre>
        <p>If the processor you are using is unable to support a
        variable with this type specification, a compile-time
        error will result. </p>
        <p>To declare a real variable to have the equivalent of
        Fortran 77 accuracy DOUBLE PRECISION, simply do this: </p>
        <pre>
   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: DP = SELECTED_REAL_KIND(14)
   REAL(KIND = DP) :: A
</pre>
        <p>This declares the variable A to be of type real and
        have at least 14 decimal places of accuracy. </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Program composition </h3>

<p>The basic form of a Fortran 90 program is as follows: </p>

<pre>
PROGRAM <em>name</em>
   <em>declarations</em>
   <em>executable statements</em>
END PROGRAM <EM.name</EM>
</pre>
