<h2>10. Derived data types </h2>

<p>A useful feature in Fortran 90 is the ability to define
derived data types. This feature is similar to the structure
feature of the C programming language. The manner in which one
defines and uses a derived data type is best illustrated through
example: </p>

<pre>
   TYPE Point
      REAL :: X, Y
   END TYPE Point

   TYPE Circle
      TYPE (Point) :: Center
      REAL :: Radius
   END TYPE Circle

   TYPE (Circle) :: C
</pre>

<p>This declares the variable C to be of type Circle. C formally
has two components. The first component, Circle, is itself a
derived data type consisting of two real components called X and
Y. The second component of C is a variable named Radius of type
real. </p>

<p>The variable C may be assigned a value in either of these
ways: </p>

<pre>
C = Circle(Point(0., 0.), 1.)
</pre>

<p>or, equivalently </p>

<pre>
C%Center%X = 0.
C%Center%Y = 0.
C%Radius = 1.
</pre>

<p>In both cases, the &quot;circle&quot; C was assigned the
center point (0., 0.) and given the radius 1. (the unit circle). </p>

<p>There are many practical uses for derived data types. And,
these data types function just like any other variable in a
program unit, namely, they may be initialized, modified, and even
passed to subprograms as parameters. </p>
