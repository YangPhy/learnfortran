<h2>3. How to use Fortran 90 on the Unix Computers at Stanford </h2>

<h3>Practical Details</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the Fortran 90 compiler that resides on the Sun
computers in the leland system is unreliable. However, there is
no alternative at this time. If you think you're program should
compile but it won't, then it might not be your fault. See the
instructor if you think the compiler is misbehaving. </p>

<h3>Compiling, linking, and executing</h3>

<p>In virtually the same manner in which we compiled our Fortran
77 routines, we can process our Fortran 90 programs. To compile
and link a Fortran 90 source code with the name <em>main.f90</em>,
simply type </p>

<pre>
f90 main.f90
</pre>

<p>This will create an executable file called <em>a.out</em>. </p>

<p>Fortran 90 programs which make use of the free format form (to
be explained in the next section) must have an extension <em>.f90</em>.
</p>

<p>Just as with the Fortran 77 compiler, we are able to specify
the name of our executable file with the Fortran90 compiler by
specifying the -o option: </p>

<pre>
f90 main.f90 -o main.out 
</pre>

<p>This will create an executable file called <em>main.out</em>. </p>

<p>Similarly, we can link to a Fortran 90 compiled library (such
as the BLAS/LAPACK library in the class account) by </p>

<pre>
f90 main.f90 -L/usr/class/me390/lib -lmy_lib90
</pre>

<p>This will link your program <em>main.f90</em> to the compiled
library called <em>libmy_lib90.a</em> which resides on the class
account in the directory <em>/usr/class/me390/lib</em>. You may
copy this library file to your own account if you wish. However,
the file is rather large and may cause you to exceed your disk
quota on the leland system. A better approach would be to simply
compile your programs requiring the BLAS/LAPACK library using the
command given above. </p>

<p>Note: the library libmy_lib90.a MUST have been created using
the Fortran 90 compiler. Attempts to link a Fortran 90 program to
a Fortran 77 library will fail. </p>
