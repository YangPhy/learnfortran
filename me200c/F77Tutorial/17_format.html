<h2>17. Format statements</h2>

<p>So far we have mostly used <em>free format</em> input/output.
This uses a set of default rules for how to input and output
values of different types (integers, reals, characters, etc.).
Often the programmer wants to specify some particular input or
output format, e.g., how many decimals places in real numbers.
For this purpose Fortran 77 has the <em>format</em> statement.
The same format statements are used for both input and output. </p>

<h3>Syntax </h3>

<pre>
      write(*, <em>label</em>) <em>list-of-variables</em>
 <em>label</em> format <em>format-code</em>
</pre>

<p>A simple example demonstrates how this works. Say you have an
integer variable you want to print in a field 4 characters wide
and a real number you want to print in fixed point notation with
3 decimal places. </p>

<pre>
      write(*, 900) i, x
  900 format (I4,F8.3)
</pre>

<p>The format label 900 is chosen somewhat arbitrarily, but it is
common practice to number format statements with higher numbers
than the control flow labels. After the keyword <tt>format</tt>
follows the format codes enclosed in parenthesis. The code I4
stands for an integer with width four, while F8.3 means that the
number should be printed using fixed point notation with field
width 8 and 3 decimal places. </p>

<p>The format statement may be located anywhere within the
program unit. There are two programming styles: Either the format
statement follows directly after the read/write statement, or all
the format statements are grouped together at the end of the
(sub-)program. </p>

<h3>Common format codes</h3>

<p>The most common format code letters are: </p>

<pre>
   A - text string
   D - double precision numbers, exponent notation
   E - real numbers, exponent notation
   F - real numbers, fixed point format
   I - integer
   X - horizontal skip (space)
   / - vertical skip (newline)
</pre>

<p>The format code F (and similarly D, E) has the general form F<em>w.d</em>
where <em>w</em> is an integer constant denoting the field width
and <em>d</em> is an integer constant denoting the number of
significant digits. </p>

<p>For integers only the field width is specified, so the syntax
is <tt>I</tt><em>w</em>. Similarly, character strings can be
specified as <tt>A</tt><em>w</em> but the field width is often
dropped. </p>

<p>If a number or string does not fill up the entire field width,
spaces will be added. Usually the text will be adjusted to the
right, but the exact rules vary among the different format codes.
</p>

<p>For horizontal spacing, the <em>n</em><tt>X</tt> code is often
used. This means <em>n</em> horizontal spaces. If <em>n</em> is
omitted, <em>n=1</em> is assumed. For vertical spacing
(newlines), use the code <tt>/</tt>. Each slash corresponds to
one newline. Note that each read or write statement by default
ends with a newline (here Fortran differs from C). </p>

<h3>Some examples</h3>

<p>This piece of Fortran code </p>

<pre>
      x = 0.025
      write(*,100) 'x=', x
  100 format (A,F)
      write(*,110) 'x=', x
  110 format (A,F5.3)
      write(*,120) 'x=', x
  120 format (A,E)
      write(*,130) 'x=', x
  130 format (A,E8.1)
</pre>

<p>produces the following output when we run it: </p>

<pre>
x=      0.0250000
x=0.025
x=  0.2500000E-01
x= 0.3E-01
</pre>

<p>Note how blanks are automatically padded on the left and that
the default field width for real numbers is usually 14. We see
that Fortran 77 follows the rounding rule that digits 0-4 are
rounded downwards while 5-9 are rounded upwards. </p>

<p>In this example each write statement used a different format
statement. But it is perfectly fine to use the same format
statement for many different write statements. In fact, this is
one of the main advantages of using format statements. This
feature is handy when you print tables for instance, and want
each row to have the same format. </p>

<h3>Format strings in read/write statements</h3>

<p>Instead of specifying the format code in a separate format
statement, one can give the format code in the read/write
statement directly. For example, the statement </p>

<pre> 
      write (*,'(A, F8.3)') 'The answer is x = ', x
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to </p>

<pre> 
      write (*,990) 'The answer is x = ', x
  990 format (A, F8.3)
</pre>

<p>Sometimes text strings are given in the format statements,
e.g. the following version is also equivalent: </p>

<pre> 
      write (*,999) x
  999 format ('The answer is x = ', F8.3)
</pre>

<h3>Implicit loops and repeat counts</h3>

<p>Now let us do a more complicated example. Say you have a
two-dimensional array of integers and want to print the upper
left 5 by 10 submatrix with 10 values each on 5 rows. Here is
how: </p>

<pre>
      do 10 i = 1, 5
         write(*,1000) (a(i,j), j=1,10)
   10 continue
 1000 format (I6)
</pre>

<p>We have an explicit do loop over the rows and an <em>implicit</em>
loop over the column index j. </p>

<p>Often a format statement involves repetition, for example </p>

<pre>
  950 format (2X, I3, 2X, I3, 2X, I3, 2X, I3)
</pre>

<p>There is a shorthand notation for this: </p>

<pre>
  950 format (4(2X, I3))
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to allow repetition without explicitly
stating how many times the format should be repeated. Suppose you
have a vector where you want to print the first 50 elements, with
ten elements on each line. Here is one way: </p>

<pre>
      write(*,1010) (x(i), i=1,50)
 1010 format (10I6)
</pre>

<p>The format statement says ten numbers should be printed. But
in the write statement we try to print 50 numbers. So after the
ten first numbers have been printed, the same format statement is
automatically used for the next ten numbers and so on. </p>

<p>Implicit do-loops can be multi-dimensional and can be used to
make an read or write statement difficult to understand. You
should avoid using implicit loops which are much more complicated
than the ones shown here. </p>
