<h2>11. Subprograms</h2>

<p>When a program is more than a few hundred lines long, it gets
hard to follow. Fortran codes that solve real engineering
problems often have tens of thousands of lines. The only way to
handle such big codes, is to use a <em>modular</em> approach and
split the program into many separate smaller units called <em>subprograms</em>.
</p>

<p>A subprogram is a (small) piece of code that solves a well
defined subproblem. In a large program, one often has to solve
the same subproblems with many different data. Instead of
replicating code, these tasks should be solved by subprograms .
The same subprogram can be invoked many times with different
input data. </p>

<p>Fortran has two different types of subprograms, called <em>functions</em>
and <em>subroutines</em>. </p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>Fortran functions are quite similar to mathematical functions:
They both take a set of input arguments (parameters) and return a
value of some type. In the preceding discussion we talked about <em>user
defined</em> subprograms. Fortran 77 also has some <em>intrinsic</em>
(built-in) functions. </p>

<p>A simple example illustrates how to use a function: </p>

<pre>
      x = cos(pi/3.0)
</pre>

<p>Here <tt>cos</tt> is the cosine function, so <tt>x</tt> will
be assigned the value 0.5 (if <tt>pi</tt> has been correctly
defined; Fortran 77 has no built-in constants). There are many
intrinsic functions in Fortran 77. Some of the most common are: </p>

<pre>
      abs     <em>absolute value</em>
      min     <em>minimum value</em>
      max     <em>maximum value</em>
      sqrt    <em>square root</em>
      sin     <em>sine</em>
      cos     <em>cosine</em>
      tan     <em>tangent</em>
      atan    <em>arctangent</em>
      exp     <em>exponential (natural)</em>
      log     <em>logarithm (natural)</em>
</pre>

<p>In general, a function always has a <em>type</em>. Most of the
built-in functions mentioned above, however, are <em>generic</em>.
So in the example above, <tt>pi</tt> and <tt>x</tt> could be
either of type <tt>real</tt> or <tt>double precision</tt>. The
compiler would check the types and use the correct version of <tt>cos</tt>
(real or double precision). Unfortunately, Fortran is not really
a <em>polymorphic</em> language so in general you have to be
careful to match the types of your variables and your functions! </p>

<p>Now we turn to the user-written functions. Consider the
following problem: A meteorologist has studied the precipitation
levels in the Bay Area and has come up with a model <em>r(m,t)</em>
where <em>r</em> is the amount of rain, <em>m</em> is the month,
and <em>t</em> is a scalar parameter that depends on the
location. Given the formula for <em>r</em> and the value of <em>t</em>,
compute the annual rainfall. </p>

<p>The obvious way to solve the problem is to write a loop that
runs over all the months and sums up the values of <em>r</em>.
Since computing the value of <em>r</em> is an independent
subproblem, it is convenient to implement it as a function. The
following main program can be used: </p>

<pre>
      program rain
      real r, t, sum
      integer m
 
      read (*,*) t
      sum = 0.0
      do 10 m = 1, 12
         sum = sum + r(m, t)
  10  continue
      write (*,*) 'Annual rainfall is ', sum, 'inches'

      stop
      end
</pre>

<p>Note that we have declared 'r' to be 'real' just as we would a
variable. In addition, the function <em>r</em> has to be defined
as a Fortran function. The formula the meteorologist came up with
was </p>

<pre>
      r(m,t) = t/10 * (m**2 + 14*m + 46) <em>if this is positive</em>
      r(m,t) = 0                         <em>otherwise        </em>
</pre>

<p>The corresponding Fortran function is </p>

<pre>
      real function r(m,t)
      integer m
      real t

      r = 0.1*t * (m**2 + 14*m + 46)
      if (r .LT. 0) r = 0.0

      return
      end
</pre>

<p>We see that the structure of a function closely resembles that
of the main program. The main differences are: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Functions have a type. This type must also be declared in
        the calling program. </li>
    <li>The return value should be stored in a variable with the
        same name as the function. </li>
    <li>Functions are terminated by the <em>return</em> statement
        instead of <em>stop</em>. </li>
</ul>

<p>To sum up, the general syntax of a Fortran 77 function is: </p>

<pre>
      <em>type</em> function <em>name (list-of-variables)</em>
      <em>declarations</em>
      <em>statements</em>
      return
      end
</pre>

<p>The function has to be declared with the correct type in the
calling program unit. If you use a function which has not been
declared, Fortran will try to use the same implicit typing used
for variables, probably getting it wrong. The function is called
by simply using the function name and listing the parameters in
parenthesis. </p>

<p>It should be noted that strictly speaking Fortran 77 doesn't
permit recursion (functions which call themselves). However, it
is not uncommon for a compiler to allow recursion. </p>

<h3>Subroutines</h3>

<p>A Fortran function can essentially only return one value.
Often we want to return two or more values (or sometimes none!).
For this purpose we use the <tt>subroutine</tt> construct. The
syntax is as follows: </p>

<pre>
      subroutine <em>name (list-of-arguments)</em>
      <em>declarations</em>
      <em>statements</em>
      return
      end
</pre>

<p>Note that subroutines have no type and consequently should not
(cannot) be declared in the calling program unit. They are also
invoked differently than functions, using the word <em>call</em>
before their names and parameters. </p>

<p>We give an example of a very simple subroutine. The purpose of
the subroutine is to swap two integers. </p>

<pre>
      subroutine iswap (a, b)
      integer a, b
c Local variables
      integer tmp

      tmp = a
      a = b
      b = tmp

      return
      end
</pre>

<p>Note that there are two blocks of variable declarations here.
First, we declare the input/output parameters, i.e. the variables
that are common to both the caller and the callee. Afterwards, we
declare the <em>local variables</em>, i.e. the variables that can
only be used within this subprogram. We can use the same variable
names in different subprograms and the compiler will know that
they are different variables that just happen to have the same
names. </p>

<h3>Call-by-reference</h3>

<p>Fortran 77 uses the so-called <em>call-by-reference</em>
paradigm. This means that instead of just passing the values of
the function/subroutine arguments (<em>call-by-value</em>), the
memory address of the arguments (pointers) are passed instead. A
small example should show the difference: </p>

<pre>
      program callex
      integer m, n
c
      m = 1
      n = 2 

      call iswap(m, n)
      write(*,*) m, n

      stop
      end
</pre>

<p>The output from this program is &quot;2 1&quot;, just as one
would expect. However, if Fortran 77 had been using call-by-value
then the output would have been &quot;1 2&quot;, i.e. the
variables m and n were unchanged! The reason for this is that
only the values of m and n had been copied to the subroutine
iswap, and even if a and b were swapped inside the subroutine the
new values would not have been passed back to the main program. </p>

<p>In the above example, call-by-reference was exactly what we
wanted. But you have to be careful about this when writing
Fortran code, because it is easy to introduce undesired <em>side
effects</em>. For example, sometimes it is tempting to use an
input parameter in a subprogram as a local variable and change
its value. Since the new value will then propagate back to the
calling program with an unexpected value, you should <em>never</em>
do this unless (like our iswap subroutine) the change is part of
the purpose of the subroutine. </p>

<p>We will come back to this issue in a later section on passing
arrays as arguments (parameters). </p>
