<h2>8. The <tt>if</tt> statements </h2>

<p>An important part of any programming language are the <em>conditional
statements</em>. The most common such statement in Fortran is the
<tt>if</tt> statement, which actually has several forms. The
simplest one is the logical <tt>if</tt> statement: </p>

<pre>
      if (<em>logical expression</em>) <em>executable statement</em>
</pre>

<p>This has to be written on one line. This example finds the
absolute value of x: </p>

<pre>
      if (x .LT. 0) x = -x
</pre>

<p>If more than one statement should be executed inside the <tt>if</tt>,
then the following syntax should be used: </p>

<pre>
      if (<em>logical expression</em>) then
         <em>statements</em>
      endif
</pre>

<p>The most general form of the <tt>if</tt> statement has the
following form: </p>

<pre>
      if (<em>logical expression</em>) then
         <em>statements</em>
      elseif (<em>logical expression</em>) then
         <em>statements</em>
       :
       :
      else
         <em>statements</em>
      endif
</pre>

<p>The execution flow is from top to bottom. The conditional
expressions are evaluated in sequence until one is found to be
true. Then the associated statements are executed and the control
resumes after the <tt>endif</tt>. </p>

<h3>Nested <tt>if</tt> statements</h3>

<p><tt>if</tt> statements can be nested in several levels. To
ensure readability, it is important to use proper indentation.
Here is an example: </p>

<pre>
      if (x .GT. 0) then
         if (x .GE. y) then
            write(*,*) 'x is positive and x &gt;= y'
         else
            write(*,*) 'x is positive but x <y' endif elseif (x .LT. 0) then write(*,*) 'x is negative' else write(*,*) 'x is zero' endif </PRE>
You should avoid nesting many levels of <tt>if</tt> statements
since things get hard to follow.
