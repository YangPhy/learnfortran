<title>Fortran 77 Tutorial</title>
</head>

<h2>1. Preface</h2>

<p>The goal of this Fortran tutorial is to give a quick
introduction to the most common features of the Fortran 77
programming language. A companion tutorial introduces the key
enhancements found in Fortran 90. It is <em>not</em> a complete
reference! Many details have been omitted. The presentation
focuses on scientific computations, mainly linear algebra. The
outline of this tutorial was inspired by the book <em>&quot;Handbook
for Matrix Computations&quot;</em> by T.F. Coleman and C. Van
Loan, published by <a href="http://www.siam.org/">SIAM</a>.
Sections of this tutorial pertaining to Fortran 90 were based on
the book <em>&quot;FORTRAN 77 for Engineers and Scientists with
an Introduction to Fortran 90&quot;</em> by L. Nyhoff and S.
Leestma published by Prentice Hall. </p>

<p>This tutorial was designed by Erik Boman to be used in the
course <em>SCCM-001-F: Introduction to Fortran</em> taught at
Stanford University, Winter quarter 1996. It has been modified by
Sarah T. Whitlock and Paul H. Hargrove for use in the Fortran
courses which have been offered under different course numbers
each subsequent year. Permission to use this tutorial for
educational and other non-commercial purposes is granted provided
all author and copyright information is retained. </p>
