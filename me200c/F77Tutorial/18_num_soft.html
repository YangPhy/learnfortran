<h2>18. Numerical Software</h2>

<p>Most computational problems in engineering can be broken down
into well-known types of calculations, e.g., solving linear
systems of equations, computing fast Fourier transforms, etc.
Furthermore, software to solve these subtasks is often already
available. Consequently, you only have to write a short <em>driver</em>
routine for your particular problem. This way people don't have
to reinvent the wheel over and over again. </p>

<p>The best software for a particular type of problem must often
be purchased from a commercial company, but for linear algebra
and some other basic numerical computations there is high-quality
free software available (through Netlib). </p>

<h3>Netlib</h3>

<p>Netlib (the NET LIBrary) is a large collection of freely
available software, documents, and databases of interest to the
numerical, scientific computing, and other communities. The
repository is maintained by AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, the
University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and
replicated at several sites around the world. </p>

<p>Netlib contains high-quality software that has been
extensively tested, but (as all free software) it comes with no
warranty and little (if any) support. In order to use the
software, you first have to download it to your computer and then
compile it yourself. </p>

<p>There are many ways to access Netlib. The most common methods
are the World Wide Web, e-mail, and ftp: </p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>World Wide Web (WWW) </strong><address>
            <a href="http://www.netlib.org/">http://www.netlib.org/</a>
        </address>
    </li>
    <li><strong>e-mail<br>
        </strong>Send the message: <pre>
send index
</pre>
        <p>to </p>
        <address>
            netlib@netlib.org 
        </address>
        <p>to receive a contents summary and instructions. </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>ftp<br>
        </strong>Anonymous ftp to: <address>
            <a href="ftp://ftp.netlib.org/">ftp.netlib.org</a> 
        </address>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Two of the most popular packages at Netlib are the BLAS and
LAPACK libraries which we will describe in later sections. </p>

<h3>Some commercial Fortran packages</h3>

<p>In this section we briefly mention a few of the largest
(commercial) software packages for general numerical
computations. </p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>NAG</strong> </dt>
    <dd>The Numerical Algorithms Group (<a
        href="http://www.nag.co.uk/">NAG</a>) has developed a <a
        href="http://www.nag.co.uk:70/numeric/FLOLCH.html">Fortran
        library</a> containing over 1000 user-callable
        subroutines for solving general applied math problems,
        including: ordinary and partial differential equations,
        optimization problems, FFT and other transforms,
        quadrature, linear algebra, non-linear equations,
        integral equations, and more. </dd>
    <dt><strong>IMSL</strong> </dt>
    <dd>The <a href="http://www.vni.com/">IMSL Fortran numerical
        library</a> is made by <a href="http://www.vni.com/">Visual
        Numerics, Inc. </a>and covers most of the areas contained
        in the NAG library. It also has support for analyzing and
        presenting statistical data in scientific and business
        applications. </dd>
    <dt><strong>Numerical recipes</strong> </dt>
    <dd>The books <em>Numerical Recipes in C/Fortran</em> are
        very popular among engineers because they can be used as
        a cookbooks where you can find a &quot;recipe&quot; to
        solve the problem at hand. However, the corresponding
        software <a
        href="http://cfata2.harvard.edu/nr/nrhome.html">Numerical
        Recipes</a> is in no way (e.g. scope or quality)
        comparable to that provided by NAG or IMSL. </dd>
</dl>

<p>It should be mentioned that all the software listed above also
comes in a C version (or is at least callable from C). </p>
