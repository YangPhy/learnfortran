<h2>5. Variables, types, and declarations</h2>

<h3>Variable names</h3>

<p>Variable names in Fortran consist of 1-6 characters chosen
from the letters <tt>a-z</tt> and the digits <tt>0-9</tt>. The
first character must be a letter. Fortran 77 does not distinguish
between upper and lower case, in fact, it assumes all input is
upper case. However, nearly all Fortran 77 compilers will accept
lower case. If you should ever encounter a Fortran 77 compiler
that insists on upper case it is usually easy to convert the
source code to all upper case. </p>

<p>The words which make up the Fortran language are called <em>reserved
words</em> and cannot be used as names of variable. Some of the
reserved words which we have seen so far are &quot;program&quot;,
&quot;real&quot;, &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;end&quot;. </p>

<h3>Types and declarations</h3>

<p>Every variable <em>should</em> be defined in a <em>declaration</em>.
This establishes the <em>type</em> of the variable. The most
common declarations are: </p>

<pre>
      integer   <em>list of variables</em>
      real      <em>list of variables</em>
      double precision  <em>list of variables</em>
      complex   <em>list of variables</em>
      logical   <em>list of variables</em>
      character <em>list of variables</em>
</pre>

<p>The <em>list of variables</em> should consist of variable
names separated by commas. Each variable should be declared
exactly once. If a variable is undeclared, Fortran 77 uses a set
of <em>implicit rules</em> to establish the type. This means all
variables starting with the letters <tt>i-n</tt> are integers and
all others are real. Many old Fortran 77 programs uses these
implicit rules, but <em>you should not!</em> The probability of
errors in your program grows dramatically if you do not
consistently declare your variables. </p>

<h3>Integers and floating point variables</h3>

<p>Fortran 77 has only one type for integer variables. Integers
are usually stored as 32 bits (4 bytes) variables. Therefore, all
integer variables should take on values in the range [-m,m] where
m is approximately 2*10^9. </p>

<p>Fortran 77 has two different types for floating point
variables, called <tt>real</tt> and <tt>double precision</tt>.
While <tt>real</tt> is often adequate, some numerical
calculations need very high precision and <tt>double precision</tt>
should be used. Usually a real is a 4 byte variable and the
double precision is 8 bytes, but this is machine dependent. Some
non-standard Fortran versions use the syntax <tt>real*8</tt> to
denote 8 byte floating point variables. </p>

<h3>The <tt>parameter</tt> statement</h3>

<p>Some constants appear many times in a program. It is then
often desirable to define them only once, in the beginning of the
program. This is what the <tt>parameter</tt> statement is for. It
also makes programs more readable. For example, the circle area
program should rather have been written like this: </p>

<pre>
      program circle
      real r, area, pi
      parameter (pi = 3.14159)
 
c This program reads a real number r and prints
c the area of a circle with radius r.
 
      write (*,*) 'Give radius r:'
      read  (*,*) r
      area = pi*r*r
      write (*,*) 'Area = ', area
 
      stop
      end
</pre>

<p>The syntax of the parameter statement is </p>

<pre>
      parameter (<em>name = constant, ... , name = constant</em>)
</pre>

<p>The rules for the <tt>parameter</tt> statement are: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The <em>name</em> defined in the <tt>parameter</tt>
        statement is not a variable but rather a constant. (You
        cannot change its value at a later point in the program.)
    </li>
    <li>A <em>name</em> can appear in at most one <tt>parameter</tt>
        statement. </li>
    <li>The <tt>parameter</tt> statement(s) must come before the
        first executable statement. </li>
</ul>

<p>Some good reasons to use the <tt>parameter</tt> statement are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>It helps reduce the number of typos. </li>
    <li>It makes it easier to change a constant that appears many
        times in a program. </li>
    <li>It increases the readability of your program. </li>
</ul>
