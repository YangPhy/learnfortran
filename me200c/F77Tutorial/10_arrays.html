<h2>10. Arrays</h2>

<p>Many scientific computations use vectors and matrices. The
data type Fortran uses for representing such objects is the <em>array</em>.
A one-dimensional array corresponds to a vector, while a
two-dimensional array corresponds to a matrix. To fully
understand how this works in Fortran 77, you will have to know
not only the syntax for usage, but also how these objects are
stored in memory in Fortran 77. </p>

<h3>One-dimensional arrays</h3>

<p>The simplest array is the one-dimensional array, which is just
a sequence of elements stored consecutively in memory. For
example, the declaration </p>

<pre>
      real a(20)
</pre>

<p>declares <tt>a</tt> as a real array of length 20. That is, <tt>a</tt>
consists of 20 real numbers stored contiguously in memory. By
convention, Fortran arrays are indexed from 1 and up. Thus the
first number in the array is denoted by <tt>a(1)</tt> and the
last by <tt>a(20)</tt>. However, you may define an arbitrary
index range for your arrays using the following syntax: </p>

<pre>
      real b(0:19), weird(-162:237)
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>b</tt> is exactly similar to <tt>a</tt> from the
previous example, except the index runs from 0 through 19. <tt>weird</tt>
is an array of length 237-(-162)+1 = 400. </p>

<p>The type of an array element can be any of the basic data
types. Examples: </p>

<pre>
      integer i(10)
      logical aa(0:1)
      double precision x(100)
</pre>

<p>Each element of an array can be thought of as a separate
variable. You reference the i'th element of array <tt>a</tt> by <tt>a(i)</tt>.
Here is a code segment that stores the 10 first square numbers in
the array <tt>sq</tt>: </p>

<pre>
      integer i, sq(10)

      do 100 i = 1, 10
         sq(i) = i**2
  100 continue
</pre>

<p>A common bug in Fortran is that the program tries to access
array elements that are out of bounds or undefined. This is the
responsibility of the programmer, and the Fortran compiler will
not detect any such bugs! </p>

<h3>Two-dimensional arrays</h3>

<p>Matrices are very important in linear algebra. Matrices are
usually represented by two-dimensional arrays. For example, the
declaration </p>

<pre>
      real A(3,5)
</pre>

<p>defines a two-dimensional array of 3*5=15 real numbers. It is
useful to think of the first index as the row index, and the
second as the column index. Hence we get the graphical picture: </p>

<pre>
   (1,1)  (1,2)  (1,3)  (1,4)  (1,5)
   (2,1)  (2,2)  (2,3)  (2,4)  (2,5)
   (3,1)  (3,2)  (3,3)  (3,4)  (3,5)
</pre>

<p>Two-dimensional arrays may also have indices in an arbitrary
defined range. The general syntax for declarations is: </p>

<pre>
     <em>name (low_index1 : hi_index1, low_index2 : hi_index2)</em>
</pre>

<p>The total size of the array is then </p>

<pre>
     <em>size = (hi_index1-low_index1+1)*(hi_index2-low_index2+1)</em>
</pre>

<p>It is quite common in Fortran to declare arrays that are
larger than the matrix we want to store. (This is because Fortran
does not have dynamic storage allocation.) This is perfectly
legal. Example: </p>

<pre>
      real A(3,5)
      integer i,j
c
c     We will only use the upper 3 by 3 part of this array.
c
      do 20 j = 1, 3
         do 10 i = 1, 3
            a(i,j) = real(i)/real(j)
   10    continue
   20 continue
</pre>

<p>The elements in the submatrix A(1:3,4:5) are undefined. Do not
assume these elements are initialized to zero by the compiler
(some compilers will do this, but not all). </p>

<h3>Storage format for 2-dimensional arrays</h3>

<p>Fortran stores higher dimensional arrays as a contiguous
sequence of elements. It is important to know that 2-dimensional
arrays are stored <em>by column</em>. So in the above example,
array element (1,2) will follow element (3,1). Then follows the
rest of the second column, thereafter the third column, and so
on. </p>

<p>Consider again the example where we only use the upper 3 by 3
submatrix of the 3 by 5 array <tt>A(3,5)</tt>. The 9 interesting
elements will then be stored in the first nine memory locations,
while the last six are not used. This works out neatly because
the <em>leading dimension</em> is the same for both the array and
the matrix we store in the array. However, frequently the leading
dimension of the array will be larger than the first dimension of
the matrix. Then the matrix will <em>not</em> be stored
contiguously in memory, even if the array is contiguous. For
example, suppose the declaration was <tt>A(5,3)</tt> instead.
Then there would be two &quot;unused&quot; memory cells between
the end of one column and the beginning of the next column (again
we are assuming the matrix is 3 by 3). </p>

<p>This may seem complicated, but actually it is quite simple
when you get used to it. If you are in doubt, it can be useful to
look at how the <em>address</em> of an array element is computed.
Each array will have some memory address assigned to the
beginning of the array, that is element (1,1). The address of
element (i,j) is then given by </p>

<pre>
      <em>addr</em>[A(i,j)] = <em>addr</em>[A(1,1)] + (j-1)*lda + (i-1)
</pre>

<p>where <tt>lda</tt> is the leading (i.e. row) dimension of <tt>A</tt>.
Note that <tt>lda</tt> is in general different from the actual
matrix dimension. Many Fortran errors are caused by this, so it
is very important you understand the distinction! </p>

<h3>Multi-dimensional arrays</h3>

<p>Fortran 77 allows arrays of up to seven dimensions. The syntax
and storage format are analogous to the two-dimensional case, so
we will not spend time on this. </p>

<h3>The <tt>dimension</tt> statement</h3>

<p>There is an alternate way to declare arrays in Fortran 77. The
statements </p>

<pre>
      real A, x
      dimension x(50)
      dimension A(10,20)
</pre>

<p>are equivalent to </p>

<pre>
      real A(10,20), x(50)
</pre>

<p>This <tt>dimension</tt> statement is considered old-fashioned
style today. </p>
