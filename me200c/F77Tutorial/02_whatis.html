<h2>2. What is Fortran?</h2>

<p>Fortran is a general purpose programming language, mainly
intended for mathematical computations in e.g. engineering.
Fortran is an acronym for FORmula TRANslation, and was originally
capitalized as FORTRAN. However, following the current trend to
only capitalize the first letter in acronyms, we will call it
Fortran. Fortran was the first ever high-level programming
language. The work on Fortran started in the 1950's at IBM and
there have been many versions since. By convention, a Fortran
version is denoted by the last two digits of the year the
standard was proposed. Thus we have </p>

<ul>
    <li>Fortran 66 </li>
    <li>Fortran 77 </li>
    <li>Fortran 90 (95) </li>
</ul>

<p>The most common Fortran version today is still Fortran 77,
although Fortran 90 is growing in popularity. Fortran 95 is a
revised version of Fortran 90 which (as of early 1996) is
expected to be approved by ANSI soon. There are also several
versions of Fortran aimed at parallel computers. The most
important one is High Performance Fortran (HPF), which is a
de-facto standard. </p>

<p>Users should be aware that most Fortran 77 compilers allow a
superset of Fortran 77, i.e. they allow non-standard extensions.
In this tutorial we will emphasize standard ANSI Fortran 77. </p>

<h3>Why learn Fortran?</h3>

<p>Fortran is the dominant programming language used in
engineering applications. It is therefore important for
engineering graduates to be able to read and modify Fortran code.
From time to time, so-called experts predict that Fortran will
rapidly fade in popularity and soon become extinct. These
predictions have always failed. Fortran is the most enduring
computer programming language in history. One of the main reasons
Fortran has survived and will survive is <em>software inertia</em>.
Once a company has spent many man-years and perhaps millions of
dollars on a software product, it is unlikely to try to translate
the software to a different language. Reliable software
translation is a very difficult task. </p>

<h3>Portability</h3>

<p>A major advantage Fortran has is that it is standardized by
ANSI and ISO (see footnotes). Consequently, if your program is
written in ANSI Fortran 77, using nothing outside the standard,
then it will run on any computer that has a Fortran 77 compiler.
Thus, Fortran programs are portable across machine platforms. (If
