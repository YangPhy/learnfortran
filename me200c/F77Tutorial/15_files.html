<h2>15. File I/O</h2>

<p>So far we have assumed that the input/output has been to the
standard input or the standard output. It is also possible to
read from or write to <em>files</em> which are stored on some
external storage device, typically a disk (hard disk, floppy) or
a tape. In Fortran each file is associated with a <em>unit number</em>,
an integer between 1 and 99. Some unit numbers are reserved: 5 is
standard input, 6 is standard output. </p>

<h3>Opening and closing a file</h3>

<p>Before you can use a file you have to <em>open</em> it. The
command is </p>

<pre>
    open <em>(list-of-specifiers)</em>
</pre>

<p>where the most common specifiers are: </p>

<pre>
    [UNIT=]  <em>u</em>
    IOSTAT=  <em>ios</em>
    ERR=     <em>err</em>
    FILE=    <em>fname</em>
    STATUS=  <em>sta</em>
    ACCESS=  <em>acc</em>
    FORM=    <em>frm</em>
    RECL=    <em>rl</em>
</pre>

<p>The unit number <em>u</em> is a number in the range 1-99 that
denotes this file (the programmer may chose any number but he/she
has to make sure it is unique). </p>

<p><em>ios</em> is the I/O status identifier and should be an
integer variable. Upon return, <em>ios</em> is zero if the
statement was successful and returns a non-zero value otherwise. </p>

<p><em>err</em> is a label which the program will jump to if
there is an error. </p>

<p><em>fname</em> is a character string denoting the file name. </p>

<p><em>sta</em> is a character string that has to be either NEW,
OLD or SCRATCH. It shows the prior status of the file. A scratch
file is a file that is created when opened and deleted when
closed (or the program ends). </p>

<p><em>acc</em> must be either SEQUENTIAL or DIRECT. The default
is SEQUENTIAL. </p>

<p><em>frm</em> must be either FORMATTED or UNFORMATTED. The
default is UNFORMATTED. </p>

<p><em>rl</em> specifies the length of each record in a
direct-access file. </p>

<p>For more details on these specifiers, see a good Fortran 77
book. </p>

<p>After a file has been opened, you can access it by read and
write statements. When you are done with the file, it should be
closed by the statement </p>

<pre>
      close ([UNIT=]<em>u</em>[,IOSTAT=<em>ios</em>,ERR=<em>err</em>,STATUS=<em>sta</em>])
</pre>

<p>where, as usual, the parameters in brackets are optional. </p>

<p>In this case <em>sta</em> is a character string which can be
KEEP (the default) or DELETE. </p>

<h3>Read and write revisited</h3>

<p>The only necessary change from our previous simplified
read/write statements, is that the unit number must be specified.
But frequently one wants to add more specifiers. Here is how: </p>

<pre>
      read ([UNIT=]<em>u</em>, [FMT=]<em>fmt</em>, IOSTAT=<em>ios</em>, ERR=<em>err</em>, END=<em>s</em>)
      write([UNIT=]<em>u</em>, [FMT=]<em>fmt</em>, IOSTAT=<em>ios</em>, ERR=<em>err</em>, END=<em>s</em>)
</pre>

<p>where most of the specifiers have been described above. The
END=s specifier defines which statement label the program jumps
to if it reaches end-of-file. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>You are given a data file with xyz coordinates for a bunch of
points. The number of points is given on the first line. The file
name of the data file is <em>points.dat</em>. The format for each
coordinate is known to be F10.4 (We'll learn about FORMAT
statements in a later lesson). Here is a short program that reads
the data into 3 arrays x,y,z: </p>

<pre>
      program inpdat
c
c  This program reads n points from a data file and stores them in 
c  3 arrays x, y, z.
c
      integer nmax, u
      parameter (nmax=1000, u=20)
      real x(nmax), y(nmax), z(nmax)

c  Open the data file
      open (u, FILE='points.dat', STATUS='OLD')

c  Read the number of points
      read(u,*) n
      if (n.GT.nmax) then
         write(*,*) 'Error: n = ', n, 'is larger than nmax =', nmax
         goto 9999
      endif

c  Loop over the data points
      do 10 i= 1, n
         read(u,100) x(i), y(i), z(i)
   10 enddo
  100 format (3(F10.4))

c  Close the file
      close (u)

c  Now we should process the data somehow...
c  (missing part)

 9999 stop
      end
</pre>
