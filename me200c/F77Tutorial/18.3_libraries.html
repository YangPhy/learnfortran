<h2>18.3 Using libraries under Unix</h2>

<p>A Fortran package of subprograms may contain hundreds of
files. It is very slow and inconvenient to recompile these files
every time you want to use any of the subroutines. Under the Unix
operating system you can avoid this by making a <em>library file</em>.
The library file is an object file, so you only have to compile
your additional main (driver) program and then link it with
library. (Linking is much faster than compiling.) </p>

<p>Libraries have file names starting with <tt>lib</tt> and
ending in <tt>.a</tt>. Some libraries have already been installed
by your system administrator, usually in the directories <tt>/usr/lib</tt>
and <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt>. For example, the BLAS library MAY be
stored in the file <tt>/usr/local/lib/libblas.a</tt>. You use the
<tt>-l</tt> option to link it together with your main program,
e.g. </p>

<pre>
      f77 main.f -lblas
</pre>

<p>You can link several files with several libraries at the same
time if you wish: </p>

<pre>
      f77 main.f mysub.f -llapack -lblas 
</pre>

<p>The order you list the libraries is significant. In the
example above -llapack should be listed before -lblas since
LAPACK calls BLAS routines. </p>

<p>If you want to create your own library, you can do so by
compiling the source code to object code and then collecting all
the object files into one library file. This example generates a
library called <tt>my_lib</tt>: </p>

<pre>
       f77 -c *.f
       ar rcv libmy_lib.a *.o
       ranlib libmy_lib.a 
       rm *.o
</pre>

<p>Check the manual pages or a Unix book for more information on
the commands <tt>ar</tt> and <tt>ranlib</tt>. If you have the
library file in the current directory, you can link with it as
follows: </p>

<pre>
       f77 main.f -L. -lmy_lib
</pre>

<p>One advantage of libraries is that you only compile them once
but you can use them many times. </p>

<p>Some of the BLAS and LAPACK subroutines have been downloaded
to the class account. The files are located in <a href="src/">/usr/class/me390/src/</a>.
The routines have been compiled and collected into a library file
called <em>libmy_lib.a</em> stored in <a href="lib/libmy_lib.a">/usr/class/me390/lib/libmy_lib.a</a>.
