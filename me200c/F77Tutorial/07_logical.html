<h2>7. Logical expressions</h2>

<p>Logical expressions can only have the value <tt>.TRUE.</tt> or
<tt>.FALSE.</tt>. A logical expression can be formed by comparing
arithmetic expressions using the following <em>relational
operators</em>: </p>

<pre>
      .LT.  meaning <.LE. <=".GT.">
      .GE.          &gt;=
      .EQ.          =
      .NE.          /=
</pre>

<p>So you <em>cannot</em> use symbols like <or ="for" comparison in Fortran 77, but you have to use the correct two-letter abbreviation enclosed by dots! <P> Logical expressions
can be combined by the <em>logical operators</em> <tt>.AND. .OR.
.NOT.</tt> which have the obvious meaning. </p>

<h3>Logical variables and assignment</h3>

<p>Truth values can be stored in <em>logical variables</em>. The
assignment is analogous to the arithmetic assignment. Example: </p>

<pre>
      logical a, b
      a = .TRUE.
      b = a .AND. 3 .LT. 5/2
</pre>

<p>The order of precedence is important, as the last example
shows. The rule is that arithmetic expressions are evaluated
first, then relational operators, and finally logical operators.
Hence b will be assigned <tt>.FALSE.</tt> in the example above.
Among the logical operators the precedence (in the absence of
parenthesis) is that <tt>.NOT.</tt> is done first, then <tt>.AND.</tt>,
then <tt>.OR.</tt> is done last. </p>

<p>Logical variables are seldom used in Fortran. But logical
expressions are frequently used in conditional statements like
the <tt>if</tt> statement. </p>
