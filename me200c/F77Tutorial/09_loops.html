<h2>9. Loops</h2>

<p>For repeated execution of similar things, <em>loops</em> are
used. If you are familiar with other programming languages you
have probably heard about <em>for</em>-loops, <em>while</em>-loops,
and <em>until</em>-loops. Fortran 77 has only one loop construct,
called the <tt>do</tt>-loop. The <tt>do</tt>-loop corresponds to
what is known as a <em>for</em>-loop in other languages. Other
loop constructs have to be built using the <tt>if</tt> and <tt>goto</tt>
statements. </p>

<h3>do-loops</h3>

<p>The <tt>do</tt>-loop is used for simple counting. Here is a
simple example that prints the cumulative sums of the integers
from 1 through n (assume n has been assigned a value elsewhere): </p>

<pre>
      integer i, n, sum
 
      sum = 0
      do 10 i = 1, n
         sum = sum + i
         write(*,*) 'i =', i
         write(*,*) 'sum =', sum
  10  continue
</pre>

<p>The number 10 is a statement <em>label</em>. Typically, there
will be many loops and other statements in a single program that
require a statement label. The programmer is responsible for
assigning a unique number to each label in each program (or
subprogram). Recall that column positions 1-5 are reserved for
statement labels. The numerical value of statement labels have no
significance, so any integers can be used, in any order.
Typically, most programmers use consecutive multiples of 10. </p>

<p>The variable defined in the <tt>do</tt>-statement is
incremented by 1 by default. However, you can define the <em>step</em>
to be any number but zero. This program segment prints the even
numbers between 1 and 10 in decreasing order: </p>

<pre>
      integer i
 
      do 20 i = 10, 1, -2
         write(*,*) 'i =', i
  20  continue
</pre>

<p>The general form of the <tt>do</tt> loop is as follows: </p>

<pre>
      do <em>label  var =  expr1, expr2, expr3</em>
         <em>statements</em>
<em>label</em> continue
</pre>

<p><em>var</em> is the loop variable (often called the <em>loop
index</em>) which must be integer. <em>expr1</em> specifies the
initial value of <em>var</em>, <em>expr2</em> is the terminating
bound, and <em>expr3</em> is the increment (step). </p>

<p>Note: The <tt>do</tt>-loop variable must never be changed by
other statements within the loop! This will cause great
confusion. </p>

<p>The loop index can be of type real, but due to round off
errors may not take on exactly the expected sequence of values. </p>

<p>Many Fortran 77 compilers allow <tt>do</tt>-loops to be closed
by the <tt>enddo</tt> statement. The advantage of this is that
the statement label can then be omitted since it is assumed that
an <tt>enddo</tt> closes the nearest previous <tt>do</tt>
statement. The <tt>enddo</tt> construct is widely used, but it is
not a part of ANSI Fortran 77. </p>

<p>It should be noted that unlike some programming languages,
Fortran only evaluates the start, end, and step expressions once,
before the first pass thought the body of the loop. This means
that the following do-loop will multiply a non-negative j by two
(the hard way), rather than running forever as the equivalent
loop might in another language. </p>

<pre>
      integer i,j
 
      read (*,*) j
      do 20 i = 1, j
         j = j + 1
  20  continue
      write (*,*) j
</pre>

<h3>while-loops</h3>

<p>The most intuitive way to write a <tt>while</tt>-loop is </p>

<pre>
      while <em>(logical expr)</em> do
         <em>statements</em>
      enddo
</pre>

<p>or alternatively, </p>

<pre>
      do while <em>(logical expr)</em> 
         <em>statements</em>
      enddo
</pre>

<p>The program will alternate testing the condition and executing
the statements in the body as long as the condition in the <tt>while</tt>
statement is true. Even though this syntax is accepted by many
compilers, it is not ANSI Fortran 77. The correct way is to use <tt>if</tt>
and <tt>goto</tt>: </p>

<pre>
<em>label</em> if <em>(logical expr)</em> then
         <em>statements</em>
         goto <em>label</em>
      endif 
</pre>

<p>Here is an example that calculates and prints all the powers
of two that are less than or equal to 100: </p>

<pre>
     integer n

     n = 1
  10 if (n .le. 100) then
        write (*,*) n
        n = 2*n
        goto 10
     endif
</pre>

<h3>until-loops</h3>

<p>If the termination criterion is at the end instead of the
beginning, it is often called an until-loop. The pseudocode looks
like this: </p>

<pre>
      do
         <em>statements</em>
      until <em>(logical expr)</em>
</pre>

<p>Again, this should be implemented in Fortran 77 by using <tt>if</tt>
and <tt>goto</tt>: </p>

<pre>
<em>label</em> continue
         <em>statements</em>
      if <em>(logical expr)</em> goto <em>label</em>
</pre>

<p>Note that the logical expression in the latter version should
be the negation of the expression given in the pseudocode! </p>
