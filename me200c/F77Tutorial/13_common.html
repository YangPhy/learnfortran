<h2>13. Common blocks</h2>

<p>Fortran 77 has no <em>global</em> variables, i.e. variables
that are shared among several program units (subroutines). The
only way to pass information between subroutines we have seen so
far is to use the subroutine parameter list. Sometimes this is
inconvenient, e.g., when many subroutines share a large set of
parameters. In such cases one can use a <em>common block</em>.
This is a way to specify that certain variables should be shared
among certain subroutines. But in general, the use of common
blocks should be minimized. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Suppose you have two parameters alpha and beta that many of
your subroutines need. The following example shows how it can be
done using common blocks. </p>

<pre>
      program main
      <em>some declarations</em>
      real alpha, beta
      common /coeff/ alpha, beta

      <em>statements</em>
      stop
      end

      subroutine sub1 (<em>some arguments</em>)
      <em>declarations of arguments</em>
      real alpha, beta
      common /coeff/ alpha, beta

      <em>statements</em>
      return
      end

      subroutine sub2 (<em>some arguments</em>)
      <em>declarations of arguments</em>
      real alpha, beta
      common /coeff/ alpha, beta

      <em>statements</em>
      return
      end
</pre>

<p>Here we define a common block with the name <tt>coeff</tt>.
The contents of the common block are the two variables <tt>alpha</tt>
and <tt>beta</tt>. A common block can contain as many variables
as you like. They do not need to all have the same type. Every
subroutine that wants to use any of the variables in the common
block has to declare the whole block. </p>

<p>Note that in this example we could easily have avoided common
blocks by passing alpha and beta as parameters (arguments). A
good rule is to try to avoid common blocks if possible. However,
there are a few cases where there is no other solution. </p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<pre>
      common / <em>name</em> / <em>list-of-variables</em>
</pre>

<p>You should know that </p>

<ul>
    <li>The <tt>common</tt> statement should appear together with
        the variable declarations, before the executable
        statements. </li>
    <li>Different common blocks must have different names (just
        like variables). </li>
    <li>A variable <em>cannot</em> belong to more than one common
        block. </li>
    <li>The variables in a common block do not need to have the
        same names each place they occur (although it is a good
        idea to do so), but they must be listed in the same order
        and have the same type and size. </li>
</ul>

<p>To illustrate this, look at the following continuation of our
example: </p>

<pre>
      subroutine sub3 (<em>some arguments</em>)
      <em>declarations of arguments</em>
      real a, b
      common /coeff/ a, b

      <em>statements</em>
      return
      end
</pre>

<p>This declaration is equivalent to the previous version that
used <tt>alpha</tt> and <tt>beta</tt>. It is recommended that you
always use the same variable names for the same common block to
avoid confusion. Here is a dreadful example: </p>

<pre>
      subroutine sub4 (<em>some arguments</em>)
      <em>declarations of arguments</em>
      real alpha, beta
      common /coeff/ beta, alpha

      <em>statements</em>
      return
      end
</pre>

<p>Now alpha is the beta from the main program and vice versa. If
you see something like this, it is probably a mistake. Such bugs
are very hard to find. </p>

<h3>Arrays in common blocks</h3>

<p>Common blocks can include arrays, too. But again, this is not
recommended. The major reason is flexibility. An example shows
why this is such a bad idea. Suppose we have the following
declarations in the main program: </p>

<pre>
      program main
      integer nmax
      parameter (nmax=20)
      integer n
      real A(nmax, nmax)
      common /matrix/ A, n
</pre>

<p>This common block contains first all the elements of A, then
the integer <em>n</em>. Now assume you want to use the matrix A
in some subroutines. Then you have to include the same
declarations in all these subroutines, e.g. </p>

<pre>
      subroutine sub1 (...)
      integer nmax
      parameter (nmax=20)
      integer n
      real A(nmax, nmax)
      common /matrix/ A, n
</pre>

<p>Arrays with variable dimensions cannot appear in common
blocks, thus the value of <em>nmax</em> has to be exactly the
same as in the main program. Recall that the size of a matrix has
to be known at compile time, hence nmax has to be defined in a
parameter statement. </p>

<p>This example shows there is usually nothing to gain by putting
arrays in common blocks. Hence the preferred method in Fortran 77
is to pass arrays as arguments to subroutines (along with the
leading dimensions). </p>
