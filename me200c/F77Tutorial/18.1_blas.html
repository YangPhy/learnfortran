<h2>18.1 BLAS</h2>

<p>BLAS is an acronym for Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines. As
the name indicates, it contains subprograms for basic operations
on vectors and matrices. BLAS was designed to be used as a
building block in other codes, for example LAPACK. The source
code for BLAS is available through Netlib. However, many computer
vendors will have a special version of BLAS tuned for maximal
speed and efficiency on their computer. This is one of the main
advantages of BLAS: the calling sequences are standardized so
that programs that call BLAS will work on any computer that has
BLAS installed. If you have a fast version of BLAS, you will also
get high performance on all programs that call BLAS. Hence BLAS
provides a simple and portable way to achieve high performance
for calculations involving linear algebra. LAPACK is a
higher-level package built on the same ideas. </p>

<h3>Levels and naming conventions</h3>

<p>The BLAS subroutines can be divided into three <em>levels</em>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Vector-vector operations. <em>O(n)</em>
        data and <em>O(n)</em> work. </li>
    <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Matrix-vector operations. <em>O(n^2)</em>
        data and <em>O(n^2)</em> work. </li>
    <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Matrix-matrix operations. <em>O(n^2)</em>
        data and <em>O(n^3)</em> work. </li>
</ul>

<p>Each BLAS and LAPACK routine comes in several versions, one
for each precision (data type). The first letter of the
subprogram name indicates the precision used: </p>

<pre>
      S      Real single precision.
      D      Real double precision.
      C      Complex single precision.
      Z      Complex double precision.
</pre>

<p>Complex double precision is not strictly defined in Fortran
77, but most compilers will accept one of the following
declarations: </p>

<pre>
      double complex <em>list-of-variables</em>
      complex*16     <em>list-of-variables</em>
</pre>

<h3>BLAS 1</h3>

<p>Some of the BLAS 1 subprograms are: </p>

<ul>
    <li>xCOPY - copy one vector to another </li>
    <li>xSWAP - swap two vectors </li>
    <li>xSCAL - scale a vector by a constant </li>
    <li>xAXPY - add a multiple of one vector to another </li>
    <li>xDOT - inner product </li>
    <li>xASUM - 1-norm of a vector </li>
    <li>xNRM2 - 2-norm of a vector </li>
    <li>IxAMAX - find maximal entry in a vector </li>
</ul>

<p>The first letter (x) can be any of the letters S,D,C,Z
depending on the precision. A quick reference to BLAS 1 can be
found at <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/blasqr.ps">http://www.netlib.org/blas/blasqr.ps</a>
</p>

<h3>BLAS 2</h3>

<p>Some of the BLAS 2 subprograms are: </p>

<ul>
    <li>xGEMV - general matrix-vector multiplication </li>
    <li>xGER - general rank-1 update </li>
    <li>xSYR2 - symmetric rank-2 update </li>
    <li>xTRSV - solve a triangular system of equations </li>
</ul>

<p>A detailed description of BLAS 2 can be found at <a
href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/blas2-paper.ps">http://www.netlib.org/blas/blas2-paper.ps</a>.
</p>

<h3>BLAS 3</h3>

<p>Some of the BLAS 3 subprograms are: </p>

<ul>
    <li>xGEMM - general matrix-matrix multiplication </li>
    <li>xSYMM - symmetric matrix-matrix multiplication </li>
    <li>xSYRK - symmetric rank-k update </li>
    <li>xSYR2K - symmetric rank-2k update </li>
</ul>

<p>The more advanced matrix operations, like solving a linear
system of equations, are contained in LAPACK. A detailed
description of BLAS 3 can be found at <a
href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/blas3-paper.ps">http://www.netlib.org/blas/blas3-paper.ps</a>.
</p>

<h3>Examples </h3>

<p>Let us first look at a very simple BLAS routine, SSCAL. The
call sequence is </p>

<pre>
      call SSCAL ( n, a, x, incx )
</pre>

<p>Here <em>x</em> is the vector, <em>n</em> is the length
(number of elements in <em>x</em> we wish to use), and <em>a</em>
is the scalar by which we want to multiply <em>x</em>. The last
argument <em>incx</em> is the <em>increment</em>. Usually, <em>incx=1</em>
and the vector <em>x</em> corresponds directly to the
one-dimensional Fortran array <em>x</em>. For <em>incx&gt;1</em>
it specifies how many elements in the array we should
&quot;jump&quot; between each element of the vector <em>x</em>.
For example, if <em>incx=2</em> it means we should only scale
every other element (note: the physical dimension of the array <em>x</em>
should then be at least <em>2n-1</em>). Consider these examples
where <em>x</em> has been declared as <tt>real x(100)</tt>. </p>

<pre>
      call SSCAL(100, a, x, 1)
      call SSCAL( 50, a, x(50), 1)
      call SSCAL( 50, a, x(2), 2)
</pre>

<p>The first line will scale all 100 elements of <em>x</em> by <em>a</em>.
The next line will only scale the last 50 elements of <em>x</em>
by <em>a</em>. The last line will scale all the even indices of <em>x</em>
by <em>a</em>. </p>

<p>Observe that the array <em>x</em> will be overwritten by the
new values. If you need to preserve a copy of the old <em>x</em>,
you have to make a copy first, e.g., by using SCOPY. </p>

<p>Now consider a more complicated example. Suppose you have two
2-dimensional arrays A and B, and you are asked to find the <em>(i,j)</em>
entry of the product A*B. This is easily done by computing the
inner product of row <em>i</em> from A and column <em>j</em> of
B. We can use the BLAS 1 subroutine SDOT. The only difficulty is
to figure out the correct indices and increments. The call
sequence for SDOT is </p>

<pre>
      SDOT ( n, x, incx, y, incy )
</pre>

<p>Suppose the array declarations were </p>

<pre>
      real A(lda,lda)
      real B(ldb,ldb)
</pre>

<p>but in the program you know that the actual size of A is <em>m*p</em>
and for B it is <em>p*n</em>. The <em>i</em>'th row of A starts
at the element <em>A(i,1)</em>. But since Fortran stores
2-dimensional arrays down columns, the next row element <em>A(i,2)</em>
will be stored <em>lda</em> elements later in memory (since <em>lda</em>
is the length of a column). Hence we set <em>incx = lda</em>. For
the column in B there is no such problem, the elements are stored
consecutively so <em>incy = 1</em>. The length of the inner
product calculation is <em>p</em>. Hence the answer is </p>

<pre>
      SDOT ( p, A(i,1), lda, B(1,j), 1 )
</pre>

<h3>How to get the BLAS </h3>

<p>First of all you should check if you already have BLAS on your
system. If not, you can find it on Netlib at <a
href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">http://www.netlib.org/blas</a>.
</p>

<h3>Documentation </h3>

<p>The BLAS routines are almost self-explanatory. Once you know
which routine you need, fetch it and read the header section that
explains the input and output parameters in detail. We will look
at an example in the next section when we address the LAPACK
routines. </p>
