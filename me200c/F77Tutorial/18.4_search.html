<h2>18.4 Searching for mathematical software</h2>

<p>A common situation is that you need a piece of code to solve a
particular problem. You believe somebody must have written
software to solve this type of problem already, but you do not
know how to find it. Here are some suggestions: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Ask your co-workers and colleagues. Always do this first,
        otherwise you can waste lots of time trying to find
        something the person next-door may have already. </li>
    <li>Check <a href="http://www.netlib.org/">Netlib</a>. They
        have a <a
        href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/misc/netlib_query.html">search
        feature</a>. </li>
    <li>Look it up in <a href="http://gams.nist.gov/">GAMS</a>,
        the Guide to Available Mathematical Software from <a
        href="http://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a>. </li>
